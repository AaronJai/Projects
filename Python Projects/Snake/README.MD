Created a game of snake in python by:
    Using tkinter game library
    Created GUI to display the game
    Created the game loop
    Listened for key presses to move the snake
    List to store the snake's body
    Check for body collision and out of bounds for game over.


Extended the project by:
    Adding option to reset and exit the game
    Resetting the game resets game to default values
        made snake and food spawn in random location
        adjusted the way text is displayed on game over
    Added variable to keep track of high score

Issue found:
    If game doesn't work check python version.
        - game worked on windows that had version 3.12, but not on mac 3.9.6
