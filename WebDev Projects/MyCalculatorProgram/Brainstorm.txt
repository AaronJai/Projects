Idea for app after creating MyCounterProgram

Model look after iPhone calculator app.

text and buttons all in one div element?
- each row has different class element.

How to display numbers? 
E.g.,
        Number1 input
                    +
        Number2 input
---------------------
[   numberpad here  ]

History of previous calculations?
- Flow on right side of calculator?
- top down or down up
- shouldn't cut off if someone reduces display size

list of other calculator elements?
e.g., exponentials, log, trig, etc.
- Appear to the left of number pad?
- how to adjust so if someone reduces window size, main number pad stays,
  but other calculator elements drop below it?
